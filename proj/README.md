This project is performing K-Means cluster algorithm

My student ID is `119010077` name with `Gao Lianhao`

# Introduction
User can click the button to modify the parameters
cluster number range from 1 to 10 (normally 5 is good)
iteration number range from 1 to infinite (usually 10 is enough for converging)
set random data size (no limit but 100 to 200 is a good choice)
Here also provides three default data with specific position
In the end, click Reset will clear and regenerate data


# How to run
unzip this file
